# anime-downloader
works on python 3.6 only

run "pip install -r Requirements.txt"

set the location of where you want the downloaded anime episodes to save in "config.py" in "requirements" 

then run "main.py"

if you want to download low quality instead of high quality 
then type "-x"  x is episode number the hyphen triggers low 
quality downloads


auto-download is broken as of 14-1-2022 and most probably will not be fixed

as of 19-8-2023 i plan to update the code but there seems to be some changes in the websites scraped so it might take long as am busy
there is no garuntee of the update
