auto-download is broken as of 14-1-2022 and most probably will not be fixed


as of 19-8-2023 i plan to update the code but there seems to be some changes in the websites scraped so it might take long and 
there is no garuntee of the update


as of 22-10-2023 the v2 repo has been deleted and this will contain v3 code in the future
the newer version has been built using 3.9 backward compatibility not tested (unreleased yet)
